          Trans Rescue is a non-profit-making foundation with the aim of helping transgender people worldwide escape from places where it is dangerous to be a transgender person.
        </span>
        <span class="body-text">
          - We have volunteers in many places across the world, but we are registered in the Netherlands as Stichting Trans Rescue Foundation, registration number 84793252.<br>
          - We are the spiritual successor of TransEmigrate. TransEmigrate operated as a loosely organized collection of volunteers. We have incorporated as Trans Rescue to regularize our fundraising and work.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p id="what-we-do" class="info">
        <span class="headline">
          We help trans people remove themselves from dangerous situations, in particular from dangerous countries.
        </span>
        <span class="body-text">
          - We do so in a way that is legal and legitimate, and as physically and emotionally safe for our clients as we can make it.<br>
          - We communicate clearly with our clients what our timetable is for moving them.<br>
          - We publish our books.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p id="what-we-dont" class="info">
        <span class="headline">
          We will never charge our clients anything for our services.
        </span>
        <span class="body-text">
          - We will never disclose information about our clients.<br>
          - We will never emotionally manipulate our clients.<br>
          - We never profit from donations. We are a non-profit-making foundation from which taking a profit is illegal.<br>
          - We have no "agents". Anyone approaching you anywhere except us is a fraud. Talk to us here.<br>
          - We don't turn “save my life” into a popularity contest.<br>
          - We don't worry what “trans” means.<br>
          - We are not here to provide funding for trans folks who are not in immediate danger and who could leave of their own free will.<br>
          - We will never break the laws of the Netherlands, where we're based.<br>
          - We never break the laws of other countries, except where necessary those laws which actively target or endanger trans people.<br>
          - We cannot give legal advice.
